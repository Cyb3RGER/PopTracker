# PopTracker
*Powerful open progress tracker* is a project to offer a universal, scriptable
randomizer tracking solution that it is open source, runs everywhere and
supports auto-tracking.

## Getting started
This is work in progress. Some pre-existing packs work, some do not.

Download a binary release or build from source.

Copy or unpack gamepacks to `EXEDIR/packs`, `HOME/PopTracker/packs`, `Documents/PopTracker/packs` or `CWD/packs` (ZIPs supported starting with v0.14.0).
On Windows it will also find packs installed in EmoTracker.
On macOS EXEDIR is *inside* the app bundle.

Use the Load button in the top left corner to load a pack.

Do not load untrusted packs until some sort of fuzzing is done.

Binary release is Windows 64bit and macOS 64bit only at the moment,
should compile on most unix-like OS (see [Building from source](#building-from-source)).
[WASM](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) support still needs a lot of work.

## Auto-tracking
### SNES
Requires [SNI](https://github.com/alttpo/sni)
or [QUsb2Snes](https://usb2snes.com) (flash cart, emu, snes mini)
or [usb2snes](https://github.com/RedGuyyyy/sd2snes/releases) (flash cart only).
See their respective documentation.

### PC
We do not allow direct access to process memory or sockets from LUA. Instead
[UAT](https://github.com/black-sliver/UAT) can be used to recieve "variables"
starting with v0.16.

### Other systems
No work has been done for other systems yet.
